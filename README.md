# Welcome to Formme!

The key to turning your designs into a reality. 

## Inspiration
We interviewed 30+ independent designers and emerging brands. Almost all of them said the same thing: “I can create… but I can’t produce.” Turning a sketch into a garment was slow, confusing, and disconnected — and that’s the problem we set out to solve.

## What it does
Formme helps designers go from idea to production by:

- Generating clear, structured tech packs
- Standardizing materials, measurements, and construction details
- Improving communication with manufacturers
- Keeping the whole workflow in one place

## How we built it
We combined:

- AI-driven parsing of sketches + design details
- A structured tech pack generator
- A matching algorithm to best match designers with their manufacturer
- Clean UI for better communication


## Challenges we ran into
Standardizing tech packs across different design styles Making a complex process feel simple Turning vague sketches into precise production details Designing a UX that doesn’t overwhelm new designers

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Built a tech pack generator designers actually enjoy using Created a smooth end-to-end flow from sketch → spec Validated the problem through 30+ interviews Turned messy production processes into clear, structured steps

## What we learned
Most designers struggle with production, not creativity Clear communication is more valuable than more tools Standardization removes huge bottlenecks Designers want confidence, not complexity

## What's next for formme
Support more garment types + variations Build a vetted manufacturer network Add pricing/MOQ estimates and sample tracking Improve real-time collaboration for designers + factories
