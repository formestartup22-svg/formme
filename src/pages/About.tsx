        <h1>Built for the realities of<br /><em>fashion production.</em></h1>
        <p>
          Formme is a fashion-tech platform built to close the gap between designers and manufacturers —
          streamlining tech packs, feasibility checks, and production workflows into one connected system.

          <span className="production-eyebrow">OUR STORY</span>
          <h2>Built by people who’ve<br />lived the problem.</h2>
          <ul className="about-story-points">
            {storyPoints.map(item => <li key={item}><Check size={15} />{item}</li>)}
          </ul>
          <p>
            We're building formme because we've lived the gap between what a designer draws and what a
            factory can actually produce — not guessing at it from the outside, but having felt it firsthand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past year, we've worked closely with <strong>120+ brands and manufacturers</strong> to
            understand where production breaks down — and formme is shaped by what we heard from all of
            them, not assumptions about what production teams need.
